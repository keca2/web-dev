          Hello! My name is Kevin, and I'm a junior studying computer science at PSU!
          I'm currently an intern at Oracle working with my team on data processing 
          pipeline. It's super confusing! When I'm not working or studying for school,
          I like to pretend that I read books, watch baseball, and eat raspberry sorbet.
